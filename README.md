# HD Screenshot Extension (Chromium based)

A lightweight Chromium based extension that lets you capture high resolution screenshots of web pages far beyond your monitor's native resolution. Perfect for designers, developers, and content creators who need crisp, detailed page captures.

âœ¨ Features

âœ… Capture in HD & Ultra-HD: Supports resolutions from 1920p to 8192p and beyond.

âœ… Custom Resolution: Choose any custom resolution to fit your needs, even if your screen doesnâ€™t support it.

âœ… Auto Page Load Delay: Automatically adjusts delay based on the selected resolution. Bigger screenshots = more load time.

âœ… Manual Delay Option: Set your own delay to give slow-loading pages time to finish rendering.

âœ… Simple & Fast Workflow: Inspired by the Chromium DevTools approach (Ctrl + Shift + P â†’ Capture Screenshot), but enhanced with presets and customization.

âœ… Chromium Based: Works on Chromium browsers like Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.

âœ… User-Friendly Interface: No complicated setup, just pick your resolution and capture.

ðŸ“· Why I Built This

My monitor resolution is 1366Ã—768, and I couldnâ€™t capture HD screenshots easily using built-in tools. I used to rely on Inspect Mode â†’ Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ Capture Screenshot, but it was time-consuming to adjust resolutions manually every time.
This extension automates the process with ready-to-use presets and smarter delays, saving time and effort.

ðŸ”§ Usage Example

- Select a preset resolution (e.g., 3840 Ã— 2160).

- Optionally adjust the delay.

- Click Capture.

- Get a sharp, high-quality screenshot of the full web page.
